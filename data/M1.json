Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach.

One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

After completing the course students will be able to:       *Build a basic product on two well-known cloud systems      *Make architectural decisions on choosing the right cloud type, core technologies and services      *Make business decisions on cloud vendors and the right level of investment on cloud      *Critique some current industry cloud-based solutions", "units": 12.0, "sections": [], "department": "Integrated Innovation Institute"}, "42-999": {"prereqs": null, "coreqs": null, "name": "Ph.D Thesis Defense", "lectures": [{"times": [{"end": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": null, "room": null, "days": null, "building": null}], "instructors": ["Zapanta, Conrad"], "name": "A"}], "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "desc": "Biomedical Engineering PhD Thesis Defense Examination", "units": 0.0, "sections": [], "department": "Biomedical Engineering"}, "46-751": {"prereqs": null, "coreqs": null, "name": "Accelerate Leadership", "lectures": [{"times": [{"end": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": null, "room": null, "days": null, "building": null}], "instructors": ["Meyer, Leanne"], "name": "A"}], "prereqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "coreqs_obj": {"reqs_list": null, "invert": null}, "desc": "MSPM students are required to participate in leadership training through the Tepper School Accelerate program.
