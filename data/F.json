In addition to a series of written reading responses, you will write two short arguments in an argument field of your choosing before extending one of your first two papers into a longer argument for your final paper.", "name": "TBA", "department": "English", "lectures": [{"instructors": ["Coulson, Douglas"], "times": [{"days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "room": "TBD", "end": "01:20PM", "building": "TBD", "begin": "12:00PM"}], "name": "A"}], "units": 9.0, "coreqs": null}, "12-751": {"prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "sections": [], "prereqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "desc": "The course provides a quantitative introduction to the processes that control atmospheric pollutants and the use of mass balance models to predict pollutant concentrations.

Today, we have the ability to design human-computer systems in which both human and computers act intelligently, adapt to the world and learn from experience, improving their performance over time.  How do we design such collaborative systems, taking advantage of the fundamentally different ways in which humans and computers act and learn? How do we build smart systems that achieve their intended goals, with a minimum of unintended side effects?  The mini-course will give students the opportunity to address such questions.

What cultural and technological innovations aided the Mongols rise and conquest? How did Genghiss successors rule their vast, diverse domains? What role did religion play in Mongol Eurasia?

Many critics focus on Victor Frankenstein as a figure of hubris in his pursuit of knowledge without limit, yet more in line with this collection is that in his drive to create life he did not stop to think of the consequences nor what was to become of the result. Shelleys novel warns of the possible sacrifices for knowledge and hints toward the costs to man and society, how new knowledge can redefine human existence and experience. Science and technology have rapidly advanced Shelleys time; sometimes too quickly for creators to fully consider the ramifications of new discoveries. As science fiction literature and media have matured over the past two hundred years, the themes of Frankenstein have been reinterpreted and applied to debates regarding atomic weapons, nuclear energy, cloning, bioengineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). Isaac Asimov coined the term Frankenstein Complex in his 1947 robot stories to not only warn of humanitys tenuous control over technology, but also to caution against the profit-based replacement of human labor with automation. It is the humanoid android and the cyborg that blends man and machine that evokes the most dire warnings in todays renderings of the Frankenstein Complex.

In lab, you will learn how to design and program effective graphical user interfaces, and how to perform user tests. We will cover a number of prototyping tools and require prototypes to be constructed in each, ranging from animated mock-ups to fully functional programs. Assignments will require implementing UIs, testing that interface with users, and then modifying the interface based on findings. Some class sessions will feature design reviews of student work.

Instead, many companies have overly focused on inserting technology interfaces while under-serving the customer.

We will then introduce some theories designed to solve such problems, and try to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these theories. We will apply different techniques and theories to issues that we might encounter in the real world. We will use class discussions, homeworks and papers to learn skills for evaluating arguments. These skills include: how to present a philosophic argument, what are the assumptions that justify it, what are its weaknesses and its strengths, whether such weaknesses can be resolved and, if they cannot be resolved, why.", "name": "Introduction to Philosophy", "department": "Philosophy", "lectures": [{"instructors": ["Instructor TBA"], "times": [{"days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "room": "151", "end": "11:20AM", "building": "POS", "begin": "10:30AM"}], "name": "Lec 1"}, {"instructors": ["Gray, Derrick"], "times": [{"days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "room": "151", "end": "12:20PM", "building": "POS", "begin": "11:30AM"}], "name": "Lec 2"}], "units": 9.0, "coreqs": null}, "42-203": {"prereqs_obj": {"invert": false, "reqs_list": [["42-101"], ["03-121", "03-151"]]}, "sections": [], "prereqs": "(42-101) and (03-121 or 03-151)", "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "desc": "This laboratory course is designed to provide students with the ability to make measurements on and interpret data from living systems.

How do we turn this heterogeneous mess of data into actionable insights? A common problem is that we often do not know what structure underlies the data ahead of time, hence the data often being referred to as unstructured. This course takes a practical approach to unstructured data analysis via a two-step approach. We first examine how to identify possible structure present in the data via visualization and other exploratory methods. Once we have clues for what structure is present in the data, we turn toward exploiting this structure to make predictions. Many examples are given for how these methods help solve real problems faced by organizations. Along the way, we encounter many of the most popular methods in analyzing unstructured data, from modern classics in manifold learning, clustering, and topic modeling to some of the latest developments in deep neural networks for analyzing text, images, and time series.

Facebook, Google, Amazon and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms.  This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in settings other than online platforms such as energy, transportation and education. The examples in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry.  Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts behind A/B tests and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study the associated datasets and the code used to analyze them properly.

In lab, you will learn how to design and program effective graphical user interfaces, and how to perform user tests. We will cover a number of prototyping tools and require prototypes to be constructed in each, ranging from animated mock-ups to fully functional programs. Assignments will require implementing UIs, testing that interface with users, and then modifying the interface based on findings. Some class sessions will feature design reviews of student work. This course is for HCII Masters students and HCI dual majors with a minimal programming background. Students will often not be professional programmers, but will need to interact with programmers.

Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.

It combines analytic with experimental methods to investigate strategic interactions in bidding, buying, selling, designing trading mechanisms, consumption based portfolio analysis, investment dynamics, and governance. We begin with an explanation of trading in electronic limit order markets, an exchange mechanism that has been widely adopted in the financial sector, is paradigmatic of most markets, and holds great promise for efficiently regulating procurement practices and inventory control in micromarkets. To analyze optimal trading rules, we investigate the role of arbitrage in limit order markets, and then probe more deeply into auctions, which are essentially one sided limit order markets. We describe the main kinds of auctions, investigate optimal bidding behavior, and compare revenue outcomes from different auction formats. Individual valuations form the basis for bidding and trading, and in the third section of the course we investigate how those valuations are determined. We analyze how investment profiles are valued from their underlying dynamic choice profiles, we characterize attitudes towards risk, and we explain preferences for consumption at different points in time. Armed with estimates of risk tolerance and timing preferences for consumption over the life cycle, we derive optimal consumption smoothing, which determines investment and portfolio choices, and motivates the demand for mutual and pension funds, hedging practices, and more generally a financial retail sector. This leads us to our last topic, problems peculiar to large investors, whose decisions affect the affect of the operations of the firm.

FALL 2018: Nineteenth-Century Russian Masterpieces  In the 19th century, Russian writers produced some of the most beloved works of Western literature, among them Dostoevskys Crime and Punishment, Gogols Dead Souls, and Tolstoys Anna Karenina, to name just a few. These novels continue to captivate audiences and have inspired innumerable adaptations in theater, film, and television. This course will examine the fertile century that yielded these masterpieces. In addition to the novels mentioned above, students will encounter texts by writers who may be less well known but are no less significant, including Pushkin, Lermontov, and Turgenev. We will consider the social and cultural circumstances in which these works were produced and reflect on the reasons these Russian masterpieces have appealed to audiences well beyond the Russian-speaking world. By analyzing some of Russias key cultural achievements, students will come to better understand contemporary Russian society and its place in world culture.     Students will be asked to critically analyze literary and historical texts, participate actively in class discussions, and write three short essays. This is a 9-unit course taught in English. For those proficient in Russian, however, a total of 12 units can be earned by conducting some portion of the work in Russian and meeting outside of class for some additional hours.

Prerequisites: The course is designed for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students with a wide variety of backgrounds.  The course is intended to be self-contained but students may need to do some additional work to gain fluency in core concepts.  Students should have a basic knowledge of calculus, differential equations, and chemistry as well as some previous exposure to molecular biology and biochemistry.  Experience with programming and numerical computation is useful but not mandatory.  Laboratory exercises will use MATLAB as the primary modeling and computational tool augmented by additional software as needed. *THIS COURSE WILL BE AT PITT", "name": "Cell and Systems Modeling", "department": "SCS: Computational Biology", "lectures": [{"instructors": ["Bar-Joseph, Ziv"], "times": [{"days": [2, 4], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "room": null, "end": "11:50AM", "building": null, "begin": "10:30AM"}], "name": "A"}], "units": 12.0, "coreqs": null}, "57-718": {"prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "sections": [], "prereqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "desc": "A one hour private lesson per week for all music majors.", "name": "Major Studio (Euphonium/Baritone)", "department": "Music", "lectures": [{"instructors": ["Laduke, Lance"], "times": [{"days": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "room": "DNM", "end": null, "building": "DNM", "begin": null}], "name": "A"}], "units": 9.0, "coreqs": null}, "53-600": {"prereqs_obj": {"invert": false, "reqs_list": [["53-610", "53-605", "53-607"]]}, "sections": [], "prereqs": "53-610 or 53-605 or 53-607", "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "desc": "During the semester, students on coop are considered full-time, registered Carnegie Mellon students, and pay full tuition.

In the beginning the arts were for entertainment and profit. Today, the need to entertain and pay the bills persists, yet it is set within a (mostly) nonprofit landscape in which performing arts organizations produce works to transform audiences via one or several intersecting art forms.  Producing a successful season entails selection (planning) and implementation (managing) of programs, something that is neither easy nor consistent.  Driving and complicating the situation is the usual bifurcated management structure.  Managers must find a way to implement the vision an Artistic Director - an individual with an aesthetic framework. Arts managers enable his or her artistic vision within the context of the physical, geographical and financial situation of a company.  Combining and mixing these forces is frequently messy and always an adventure.  Organizational history provides some structures to the process, but each season brings new artistic and managerial challenges against a backdrop of a rapidly changing society.

Then we will proceed to learn about the physical and computational aspects of tasks such as 3D scanning, coded photography, lightfield imaging, time-of-flight imaging, VR/AR displays, and computational light transport. Near the end of the course, we will discuss active research topics, such as creating cameras that capture video at the speed of light, cameras that look around walls, or cameras that can see through tissue. The course has a strong hands-on component, in the form of seven homework assignments and a final project. In the homework assignments, students will have the opportunity to implement many of the techniques covered in the class, by both acquiring their own images of indoor and outdoor scenes and developing the computational tools needed to extract information from them.

Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.

Shelleys novel warns of the possible sacrifices for knowledge and hints toward the costs to man and society, how new knowledge can redefine human existence and experience. Science and technology have rapidly advanced Shelleys time; sometimes too quickly for creators to fully consider the ramifications of new discoveries. As science fiction literature and media have matured over the past two hundred years, the themes of Frankenstein have been reinterpreted and applied to debates regarding atomic weapons, nuclear energy, cloning, bioengineering, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI). Isaac Asimov coined the term Frankenstein Complex in his 1947 robot stories to not only warn of humanitys tenuous control over technology, but also to caution against the profit-based replacement of human labor with automation.

How can we anticipate how sales and profits change if the firm changes its business strategy? Facebook, Google, Amazon and similar firms ask and answer questions of this kind everyday using their large online platforms. This course introduces fundamental concepts to correctly ask this type of question. We study frameworks to measure causal effects and we discuss their pros and cons. Every tool is discussed in the context of a specific example that students work on using real world datasets. Significant effort is placed on understanding how to design randomized experiments (aka A/B tests) to measure causal effects. We also discuss the most common challenges that arise when trying to design such experiments in the wild and in network settings. The concepts and tools discussed in this course are general in nature and can be applied in settings other than online platforms such as energy, transportation and education. The examples in class will be mostly drawn from our own work at the Heinz College on the media industry. Lectures are 3 hours long. In the first half of each lecture we go over concepts behind A/B tests and what to do when A/B tests are unavailable. The discussion is based on the ideas and intuition behind these concepts. In the second half of each lecture we go over specific examples -- we study the associated datasets and the code used to analyze them properly.

It is thus particularly useful when managing projects that involve dynamic and state-contingent choices among alternatives (options), especially of a strategic nature. Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic). Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision-making.

This approach assumes that managers use all the available information when making decisions.  It is thus particularly useful when managing projects that involve dynamic and state-contingent choices among alternatives (options), especially of a strategic nature.  Examples include investing in and developing new products or technology, expanding/reducing manufacturing capacity, and suspending/resuming production. The valuation of financial options is the conceptual basis of real options management (but this course does not assume prior knowledge of this topic).  Real options analysis extends this fundamental market-driven valuation approach to a much broader spectrum of business applications that feature dynamic decision making.  It thus contrasts the standard net present value rule used by static discounted cash flow analysis.  The resulting managerial decisions and asset valuations can be very different when real options analysis is used rather than static discounted cash flow analysis. A unique feature of this course is blending market-based valuation and decision making concepts and techniques within business analytics.

FALL 2018:  Social Justice in Contemporary France In this course, we will examine contemporary French culture through the lens of social justice. How does France strive to achieve greater equality among its diverse population? To what extent are these efforts successful? In order to understand the nuances and complexity of these phenomena, we will approach them through a variety of topics: the French educational system, the labor market, the situation of refugees and its implications for French society, and the French welfare system, including access to healthcare and social protection. We will study the above topics via newspaper articles and media coverage, short video clips, as well as theoretical and fictional texts. Overall, the course will provide you with a good overview of some of the most important topics that French people are concerned about, which probably played a role in the 2017 presidential election. More importantly, these topics are at the core of the current and future preoccupations of Western democratic societies, in particular in the European Union, the most ambitious political project of the modern era.

Program evaluations differ as much as the social programs they evaluate. Social programs may carry them out internally, or an external organization may be brought in. An evaluation may be highly quantitative or entirely qualitative; it may focus exclusively on needs assessment or assessing program implementation. Evaluations and their results may be highly politically charged or of interest only to direct stakeholders. There are excellent program evaluations that have had tremendous positive impacts on programs and their target populations. There are also poor or flawed program evaluations that provide weaker information than could have been obtained, provide incorrect information, or are misleading.

The goal of Language and Statistics is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipfs distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.

How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.

Peirce, was trained in chemistry and worked as a physicist, but he was also deeply concerned with the contemporary philosophical portrayal of science, which distinguished sharply between theoretical knowledge and practice. Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action. Pragmatism was also developed and vigorously popularized by William James, who aspired to be a painter and ended up as an acknowledged founder of modern empirical psychology. James extended Peirces position by defending the role of values in even the purest of empirical sciences. John Dewey, who is also well-known for his role in education, interpreted science as an evolving social system and developed a theory of aesthetics based on what we now call the psychology of problem solving.

Before it was over, the Great European Witch-Hunt of the early modern era cost the lives of thousands across Europe and in its colonies. And although the witch-hunts in early modern Europe and its colonies gradually came to an end, beliefs in witchcraft persist into the modern era and, in many parts of the world today, continue to generate campaigns of popular violence against alleged perpetrators.

In addition to the early modern witch-hunts, it will address modern witchcraft beliefs and consider witch-hunting as a global problem today.  It will focus on the origin and rationale of witch beliefs, the factors driving the timing and intensity of witch-hunts, and the patterns of accusations.

In the culture, which values and emphasizes conformity, the phenomenon is utterly unprecedented.  Accordingly, in this course, we will first explore the defining features of these anomalies  by examining how Japanese youth are portrayed in modern day fictions and films.  We will then scrutinize the extent to which these portrayals actually reflect real lives of young Japanese by analyzing newspaper articles and essays commenting on the social issues surrounding them.  Finally, we will take a close look at the dramatic social changes, over the past three decades, to trace their long-term impacts  as a significant factor contributing to the emergence of the new culture, particularly with respect to the changing youth behaviors.

From the perspective of a cancer cell, we will learn about basic concepts of cell division, DNA replication, cell signaling, cell cycle control, cell metabolism, the regulation of gene expression in human cells, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, mutations, the process of metastasis, cancer diagnosis, cancer treatments and ethical questions surrounding treating patients, the epidemiology of cancer including prevalence and historical trends in diagnosis, as well as social impacts of a cancer diagnosis. Students will also explore the primary literature and scientific review articles to better understand research and methods of investigation into the cellular and molecular processes of tumorigenesis. This course will include interactive lectures, guest speakers, and in class discussion exercises aimed at building class participation and association, as well as confidence in public speaking about the sciences. Given the well-documented link between stress and cancer, there will also be a small component aimed at making students aware of health and wellness, such as reducing stress and anxiety.", "name": "Cancer Biology", "department": "Biological Sciences", "lectures": [{"instructors": ["D'Antonio, Jason"], "times": [{"days": [1, 3, 5], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "room": "235B", "end": "11:20AM", "building": "BH", "begin": "10:30AM"}], "name": "A"}, {"instructors": ["Younis, Ihab", "Affara, Nesrine"], "times": [{"days": [1, 3, 4], "location": "Doha, Qatar", "room": null, "end": "05:50PM", "building": null, "begin": "04:30PM"}], "name": "W"}], "units": 9.0, "coreqs": "03-320 or 03-240"}, "39-390": {"prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "sections": [], "prereqs": null, "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "desc": "The college of engineering at Carnegie Mellon considers experiential learning opportunities important educational options for its undergraduate students.

The common view that mathematics - if not directly static, it evolves in a linear fashion - does not withstand historical scrutiny. Indeed, there are many dramatic conceptual developments concerning the very nature and object of mathematics.  We examine three episodes in the relatively recent past that reflect a radical transformation of the subject. They are closely associated with three mathematicians in whose work those revolutionary changes come to the fore most poignantly.  The three episodes are framed by a discussion, at the beginning, of the axiomatic method and, at the end, of contemporary computational models of mathematical thinking. The episodes fall within the period from 1854 to 1954, but have deep roots in the past. The first episode deals with the shift from geometry to arithmetic as the foundational discipline for mathematics. The accompanying change in the methodological perspective is expressed in Hilberts Foundations of Geometry, the center of the second episode. When joined with contemporaneous logical developments, that perspective underlies the formalization of mathematics. Gdels incompleteness theorems imposed theoretical limits on that work.  However, given Turings analysis of computations, the question remains, how much of mathematical reasoning can be accomplished by computing machines.

Public policy is the study of the written and unwritten principles on which law is based. Laws and regulations translate policy into action. Public policy and laws form the basis of health policy. Health policy is supported by: - Public health initiatives focused on preventing disease, prolonging life and promoting health for the entire population. (i.e. diabetes awareness) - Population health is interested in the outcomes of individual groups and the distribution of outcomes among the groups. (i.e. income equality and infant mortality) - Healthcare delivery is focused on access, quality and cost. At this time in our history, Healthcare Reform best embodies the intent of this aspect of health policy.  Through the use of group assignments, students will create a model which links external environment into healthcare delivery profitability. Modeling is a form of combining individual technical components with the greater knowledge and conceptualization of the entire process.

A major premise of the course is that intellectual capital businesses must be managed differently than capital intensive companies. One important difference is that gold collar workers (people whose value to the marketplace is their brainpower) and intelligent technology are the key corporate resources and major competitive weapons. Success also depends upon the organizations ability to create and acquire knowledge that can be easily stored, accessed, and synthesized. If (as the media tells us) knowledge is power, then harnessing this power through sound knowledge management techniques is essential for a brainpowered business.    The class will involve reading and discussion of relative uncharted topics, as well as areas of practical concern to the manager.    These topics may include:    What is Intellectual Capital and is it important?    What new rules drive brainpowered businesses, and how do these differ from the rules for managing traditional industrial or service firms?    How to think about and develop strategies for brainpowered businesses.    How to identify, attract, and retain gold collar workers.

At the same time, individuals are making use of sophisticated search engines to comparison shop at a scale that would have been physically exhausting even five years ago.

Peirce responded by constructing a comprehensive philosophy emphasizing the scientific importance of community, fallibility, and action. Pragmatism was also developed and vigorously popularized by William James, who aspired to be a painter and ended up as an acknowledged founder of modern empirical psychology. James extended Peirces position by defending the role of values in even the purest of empirical sciences.

This course proceeds simultaneously along two tracks. Track I will cover the law and procedures you need to understand how the federal budget is formulated and acted upon. This sounds dull, but it isnt For good reason, people call Congress the worlds greatest soap opera; and the budget process, while complex, is full of political warfare, the clashing of egos, and the constant pressure of voter demands. Those who know the law and procedures can gain an advantage over others in the struggle for dollars and the way they get spent.   Track II will introduce you in some of the important budget issues that have made life so difficult for Republicans and Democrats alike: working out an effective budget process, balancing the budget, funding budget priorities with limited resources, and deciding how much (and how) to tax workers and investors.   When we are working on Track II, you will develop two-pagers, the kinds of memoranda and statements written by congressional staff and political advisers.  This seminar will also assign teams to investigate selected budget issues (e.g., highway funding, defense procurement), and report back to the seminar with their findings and recommendations.

Students discover how arts enterprises are governed internally (formal leadership) and externally (public policy, market forces, and financial realities). Furthermore, students learn how enterprises engage multiple stakeholders, from artists or politicians to staff or audiences. Almost daily, arts managers are faced with choices that affect internal operation dynamics and external stakeholder relations.

The way your business interacts with government can make you a success or a failure.    Competitive markets are efficient only under certain assumptions. Governments differ in how (and if) they try to create an environment that meets those assumptions. During this course, you will gain an understanding of the factors that drive both businesses and the public to ask for government action, and most importantly, why these actions can vary by country. The overlap between the roles of business and those of government change over time and differ from place to place. The course will examine the cycles of business and government interaction, and evaluate the inputs and outcomes. For example, why does a meeting with an agency head seldom change regulations? What really influences regulatory agencies? Examples will demonstrate how business and governments interact to positively structure complicated problems and become partners for the benefit of all participants.

We tend to think of totalitarian regimes where the State controls information and prohibits the expression of dissenting views. We also tend to associate propaganda with certain rhetorical techniques - highly emotional words, deceptive representations, and glittering generalities that inhibit rational thought and manipulate public opinion. According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question: What enables propaganda to circulate? Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies.

New trade-offs have emerged for parties involved with privacy-enhancing or intrusive technologies: individuals want to avoid the misuse of the information they pass along to others, but they also want to share enough information to achieve satisfactory interactions; organizations want to know more about the parties with whom they interact, but they do not want to alienate them with policies deemed as intrusive.

Tracing the historical thread of the construction of Latin American cultural identity we will distinguish 6 periods organized around crisis when the topic of Who we are? becomes a central debate (Larrain 1996).  These periods include: the conquest and colonization, the independence and constitution of nation-states, the inter war period and the depression, the 1970s and the military dictatorships and the present globalization stage. These phases in the development of a Latin American cultural identity represent the existence of certain dominant discourses and controversies that are important in understanding Latin American culture (Larrain 1996). The idea is to explore how Latin America imagines itself and constructs a narrative about its origins and development. There are three main questions we will be exploring throughout the course: Where does the discussion about Latin America emerge from?; How does Latin America think of itself?; What does Latin America want to be?. These questions will be explored historically through readings of philosophical and political texts that deal with Latin American identity as well as with literary texts, films and music that represent practices that enact this/ese identity/ies.

What roles can social media play in non-profit advocacy, and how are those roles changing? How can we have impact while working with limited budgets?

According to such popular views, propaganda is linked to the dissemination of false information and is antithetical to the norms of democratic society. Our class will challenge these assumptions. First, instead of confining propaganda to authoritarian governments, we will examine how propaganda functions within democratic society. Indeed, we will focus on domestic propaganda in America, especially political propaganda but also propaganda in advertising and public relations. Next, instead of focusing exclusively on deceptive rhetorical techniques, we will ask a more elemental question: What enables propaganda to circulate? Answering this question will force us to consider the routines and values of corporate media as well as the power relations that give some people special access to channels of mass communication. Certainly, we will also examine propaganda messages themselves, attending to manipulative tactics as well as rhetorical strategies used to induce uptake in the mainstream press. We begin our seminar by studying key theories of propaganda, looking at primary texts for various definitions and criticisms of the concept. We will then examine how powerful institutions, especially media organizations, manage the dissemination of propaganda in democracies.

The common view that mathematics - if not directly static, it evolves in a linear fashion - does not withstand historical scrutiny. Indeed, there are many dramatic conceptual developments concerning the very nature and object of mathematics.  We examine three episodes in the relatively recent past that reflect a radical transformation of the subject. They are closely associated with three mathematicians in whose work those revolutionary changes come to the fore most poignantly.  The three episodes are framed by a discussion, at the beginning, of the axiomatic method and, at the end, of contemporary computational models of mathematical thinking. The episodes fall within the period from 1854 to 1954, but have deep roots in the past. The first episode deals with the shift from geometry to arithmetic as the foundational discipline for mathematics. The accompanying change in the methodological perspective is expressed in Hilberts Foundations of Geometry, the center of the second episode. When joined with contemporaneous logical developments, that perspective underlies the formalization of mathematics. Gdels incompleteness theorems imposed theoretical limits on that work.  However, given Turings analysis of computations, the question remains, how much of mathematical reasoning can be accomplished by computing machines.

Planning involves contrasting the application of the desired machine learning method on ideal clean data with the messy data at hand. Dealing with representation, missing data, and designing appropriate machine learning machinery are all involved in planning. Analysis involves applying the machine learning method, checking model performance and assumptions in a principled and responsible manner. Interpretation involves the transformation of algorthm outputs into meaningful and actionable characterizations of the results.

Determining the price of a product or service is one of the most important marketing decisions. It is also one of the most complex and least understood aspects of marketing. While many marketing activities are geared toward creating value for the customer, sound pricing decisions are the fundamental tool for businesses to capture the value they create. In todays hypercompetitive environment, even slight errors in determining the best price can lead to large financial losses. This course draws on the fundamental disciplines of microeconomics, statistics and psychology to shed light on good pricing practice. It surveys some popular pricing practices, explores their pitfalls, and identifies the fallacies they are based on. The first part of the course discusses the foundations for sound pricing decisions: costs, customer and competition. It then moves on to current pricing strategies, tactics and their applications: pricing over the product life cycle; product line pricing; pricing through the marketing channel; price discrimination; two-part tariffs and nonlinear pricing; price bundling; perceived value pricing; and competitive pricing. The course objectives are (1) to build the right pricing philosophy that guides everyday marketing activities, (2) to introduce a framework, based on concepts drawn from cognitive psychology, economics and industrial organization, to study pricing decisions, and (3) to master some concrete analytical and numerical tools for its successful creation, utilization, and management of sound pricing decisions", "name": "Pricing Strategy", "department": "Tepper School of Business", "lectures": [{"instructors": ["Boatwright, Peter"], "times": [{"days": [1, 3], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "room": "2202", "end": "03:15PM", "building": "TPR", "begin": "01:30PM"}], "name": "A1"}, {"instructors": ["Boatwright, Peter"], "times": [{"days": [1], "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "room": "2111", "end": "10:00PM", "building": "TPR", "begin": "06:30PM"}], "name": "E1"}, {"instructors": ["Boatwright, Peter"], "times": [{"days": null, "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "room": null, "end": null, "building": null, "begin": null}], "name": "M1"}], "units": 6.0, "coreqs": null}, "82-232": {"prereqs_obj": {"invert": false, "reqs_list": [["82-231"]]}, "sections": [], "prereqs": "82-231", "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "desc": "This is the second semester of Intermediate Chinese.

Collaborating in small interdisciplinary teams, students will partner with a local informal learning organization (e.g. museum, after school program provider, maker space) to conduct learning design research studies, synthesize findings, establish learning goals and iteratively prototype and assess design concepts.

The most abundant biological entities are bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria). Their enormous diversity and number make bacteriophages important models for the study of gene structure, function and regulation, population genetics and evolution. In addition they are the source of important tools in biotechnology. The research goals of this course will be to identify new bacteriophage species and incorporate them into a comparative genomic study to better understand the genetic organization and evolution of these organisms. While accomplishing these goals students will develop an understanding of the research process, including the ability to design experiments and interpret novel data.

To enroll, students must have ONE of the following skills: 3D modeling, high quality 2D art skills,strong programming skills, or the ability to compose and record original music and/or sound effects. The key is that there are no idea people in the course; everyone must share in the mechanical creation of the worlds. Students in the course may be assigned to a role that is not their primary skill set due to the distribution of the enrollees.

This course begins with a recap of conventional, sequential computer architecture concepts.  We will then discuss the end of convention, brought about by the end of Dennard Scaling and Moores Law, and several trends that these changes precipitated.  The first trend is the wholesale shift to parallel computer architectures and systems, covering parallel hardware and software execution models, cache coherence, memory consistency, synchronization, transactional memory, and architecture support for programming, debugging, and failure avoidance.  The second trend is the shift to incorporating specialized, heterogeneous components into parallel computer architectures.  Topics will include reconfigurable architectures, FPGAs in the datacenter, ASIC accelerators, GPGPU architectures, and the changes to the system stack that these components demand. The third trend is the emergence of newly capable hardware and software systems and new models of computation.

Both fair value accounting and risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures are necessary ingredients for financial reports to convey financial institutions risk and performance in todays world of complex, structured, value and risk partitioning financial instruments and transactions. While financial institutions often report imperfect (or worse) fair value measurements and risk and estimation sensitivity disclosures, careful joint analysis of the information they do provide invariably yields important clues about their risks and performance.

During that lecture, he had declared drawing dead for architects-this despite the fact that the most compelling explanations he made during his talk were done with rather good gestural drawings.  It had seemed to me that the work he showed lacked formal order, complexity, scale and proportion (goo would be a good word for my sense of it), and I have speculated ever since that a course in classical anatomy would be helpful in addressing those weaknesses in their idiom.  Closer to home, I began to think it would be important for our students because they (as all students do) will tend to pursue the formal clichs of our time: Maynes, Patrick Schumacher etc.    In effect, there is an assumption behind this course: that through drawing that focuses consciously upon the formal order of real organic conditions, we can come to assimilate a sense of that order in a way that can make it ultimately transferrable to design.  A more near-term goal is that by drawing organic shapes and forms, students will gain strength in understanding the geometry of non-rectilinear shapes and strengthen their ability to visualize them.    This course is a studio drawing course centered on figure-drawing.  Prescribed media are limited-charcoal and cont principally-and may be supplemented by students as desired.  The course has three parts:  Part 1 centers on the skeletal structure of dinosaurs and three conditions: hips, shoulders and torso.  Part 2 develops techniques for figure drawing.  Part 3 adds tissue, muscle and tendon, to consider whole systems of the human body.  Within part three is an in-depth project focusing on a subject of a students own choice.

At this scale, a key design requirement is that such devices can be handled at most once during their lifetime.  Batteries should be life-long, and reprogramming should be over-the-air.  How then should such devices be architected?  We begin by examining modern digital communications including modulation and coding schemes, basic RF subsystems and antennas.  We examine the computational structures that allow us to reduce communication to computation.  Anticipating that such devices will need to be highly programmable, we consider concepts from traditional computer architecture and their applicability to this energy-constrained domain. We also examine the rapid evolution of transducer technologies and how these are being integrated into SoCs.  Then, we consider how an architect can make tradeoffs across these domains to meet design objectives.

In a time of big data and widespread skepticism of science, it is crucial to understand how data and facts can be turned into conclusions, and then into public policy. Using topics from medicine, epidemiology, and public health, this course provides students an introduction into the grand challenge of understanding how evidence is used (and abused) in support of scientific conclusions. Questions of health and disease are particularly important areas for thinking about facts and figures because many life-or-death decisions have to be made on the basis of fragmentary and unreliable evidence. Every trip to the doctor, illness, and vaccination involves a complicated mix of public policy, scientific evidence, and emotional and historical factors. This course helps students understand the sciences and the humanities as united in their desire for rigorous argumentation rather than as competing or incompatible ways of thinking. Moreover, by taking a wide-angle lens to the topic, students will see how and why standards of scientific proof have changed over time, and track what these changes mean for thinking about evidence. Co-taught by a statistician and historian, this course draws on many different disciplines, providing students a broad introduction to reasoning across the humanities and social sciences.  Students will be required to participate in written and oral arguments, read scientific articles as well as political, historical, and legal documents, and prepare a capstone project in which they will be asked to weigh real-life evidence and recommend a course of action to the Food and Drug Administration.

It aims to help student explore the answers to questions on the cultural expectations behind the idea of man, woman and sex and the role the government p has played in regulating intimacy/sex/gender in different historical periods of China. Discussions will also be conducted on the changes in Chinese peoples gender/sexuality experiences in contemporary to help students develop a deeper understanding of the sexual revolution in China, and changing conceptions of gender/sexuality identity under Confucianism, Western Imperialism, socialism and globalization.

You will gain an understanding of how the global IT delivery model works and what controls and practices need to be in place to effectively lead dispersed teams. The goal of the course is to better prepare you to work on the client side, consulting side, or service provider side of a dynamic multi-sourced IT environment.  Topics covered include best practices in workload selection, vendor relations, risk management, principal agent theory, ownership models, automation planning and execution, and supplier governance. We will explore the unique business drivers in the global sourcing of application support, software development, and IT enabled services.  Classes will typically consist of lectures, guest speakers, and cases.  Our classroom provides a truly global perspective as your fellow classmates are participating from several countries, job functions, and cultures. Intelligent sourcing of knowledge-based services will be a key differentiator in an organizations ability to successfully outperform its competition.   Your ability to lead a global workforce of both people and machines and add value in decisions in this domain will make you an increasingly valuable asset to any global organization.  Learning Objectives:  1. Develop an understanding of how the global IT delivery model works and what controls and practices need to be in place to make it successful. 2.

By the end of the course, you will have an improved ability to analyze the information content of financial and managerial accounting statements for decision making. To meet this broad objective, you will develop an analytic framework of how accounting statements inform about the underlying operating, investing, and financing activities, grasp the key accounting concepts that underlie common reporting practices, and understand the way in which accounting measures are sensitive to variations in estimates, methods and possible manipulation. The course divides naturally into three related parts. The first introduces the basic bookkeeping model, including the concepts, definitions, and relationships required for a fundamental understanding of the process that produces the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement.  The second part introduces basic concepts of economic and accounting costs and their use in short-term decisions faced by managers.
