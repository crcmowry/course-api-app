Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.

Well begin with the history of political philosophy from Plato and Aristotle (two of the early critics of democracy) to the modern period and the arguments in support of republicanism as found in the Federalist Papers (Madison, Jay, Hamilton). These historical moments cast light on the philosophy behind the development of the US constitution. Following Ketcham, well discuss the debate between the ancients and moderns, enlightenment ideas regarding liberty and equality as well as the distinction between private rights and public goods.  After presenting some fundamental justifications for democracy and our current models of democratic governance, well study the basic political frameworks of our day through a thorough-going analytic analysis of the writings and arguments of recent and contemporary political philosophers such as John Rawls, Ronald Dworkin, Robert Nozick, Charles Talyor, Michael Sandel, and Annette Baier. The course will end with a discussion of the theory and practice of deliberative democracy and a chance for students to engage in this model of democracy through the activities of an ersatz deliberative poll.", "units": 9.0, "lectures": [{"times": [{"room": "150", "days": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "end": "02:50PM", "building": "BH", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "01:30PM"}], "name": "U", "instructors": ["Smith, Amelia"]}], "name": "Introduction to Political Philosophy", "department": "Philosophy", "sections": [], "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}}, "73-103": {"prereqs_obj": {"invert": false, "reqs_list": [["21-111"], ["73-102"]]}, "coreqs": null, "prereqs": "(21-111) and (73-102)", "desc": "None", "units": 9.0, "lectures": [{"times": [{"room": "5302", "days": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], "end": "11:50AM", "building": "WEH", "location": "Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania", "begin": "10:30AM"}], "name": "U", "instructors": ["Instructor TBA"]}], "name": "Principles of Macroeconomics", "department": "Economics", "sections": [], "coreqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}}, "82-133": {"prereqs_obj": {"invert": null, "reqs_list": null}, "coreqs": null, "prereqs": null, "desc": "This course is designed for students who need a more flexible approach to language learning than that offered in a standard classroom course.
